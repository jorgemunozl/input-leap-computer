I did a quick audit of the main scripts and found several classes of problems that will affect portability, reliability and maintainability:

1. Hard-coded, user-specific paths  
   • In `bin/install_input_leap.sh` you’re copying and invoking files under  
     `/home/jorge/dotfiles/...` (e.g. lines 70–74, 114, 145, 168).  
     Those paths won’t exist on anyone else’s machine. You need to derive the install directory dynamically (e.g. via `$(dirname "$0")` or a `PROJECT_ROOT` variable) rather than bake in your home directory.  
   • In `docs/TESTING-GUIDE.md` you `cd /home/jorge/project/githubProjects/input-leap`—also completely non-portable.

2. Missing “strict mode” in two key scripts  
   Most of your scripts start with `set -euo pipefail`, but  
   • `bin/connect_input_leap.sh`  
   • `bin/install_input_leap.sh`  
   do not. Without `-euo pipefail`, failures can be silently ignored or unset variables can expand to empty strings, leading to very confusing errors.

3. Inconsistent config-file locations and naming  
   • `connect_input_leap.sh` uses  
     `$HOME/.config/input-leap.conf`  
   • `network-manager` uses  
     `$HOME/.config/input-leap/network.conf`  
   • Your README speaks of `~/.config/input-leap/server.conf`  
   All three diverge. Pick one convention (e.g. `$HOME/.config/input-leap/{server,network}.conf`) and update scripts + docs to match.

4. Reliance on Arch-only package commands in a “universal” install script  
   In `install_input_leap.sh` you unconditionally call `sudo pacman -S…` and AUR helpers; but if a user on another distro runs it, it will fail. Either detect the distro first or clearly limit this script to Arch Linux only.

5. Potential sourcing of untrusted configuration  
   `connect_input_leap.sh` does `source "$CONFIG"` before validating its contents. If someone tampers with that file you could execute arbitrary code. At minimum, warn in the README or sandbox the configuration format more strictly.

6. Documentation drift  
   The README’s “Project Structure” section only lists three binaries under `bin/`, but your actual `bin/` contains many more scripts (e.g. `leap-client`, `leap-server`, `network-manager`, etc.). This kind of drift leads to confusion.

7. Minor style/robustness improvements  
   • Use `read -r` everywhere you call `read` to avoid backslash-interpretation surprises.  
   • Quote all variable expansions (most are, but watch any unquoted loops over `$interfaces` in `network-manager`).  
   • Consider checking return codes after every `sudo` invocation (e.g. copying files, restarting systemd) rather than letting later steps assume success.

Next steps  
• Fix the hard-coded paths in `install_input_leap.sh` to use a computed project root.  
• Add `set -euo pipefail` to `connect_input_leap.sh` and `install_input_leap.sh`.  
• Unify and document a single config-file naming scheme, update scripts and README accordingly.  
• Make the Arch-only installer detect or fail fast on unsupported distros.  
• Clean up docs to remove absolute-path examples.  

Let me know if you’d like patches or a deeper dive into any particular script!

Here’s a high-level, step-by-step roadmap to systematically fix the issues we uncovered:

1. **Audit & Preparation**  
   • Grep the repo for all instances of `/home/jorge` (and any other absolute paths) and list them.  
   • Identify which scripts lack `set -euo pipefail`.  
   • Catalog every config-file path (`*.conf`) in code and docs.  
   • Inventory supported distros and package managers.

2. **Parameterize Project Root & Remove Hard-Coded Paths**  
   a. In every script under `bin/` (and in `setup.sh` / `setup-ubuntu.sh`):  
      – Introduce a `PROJECT_ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/.." && pwd)"` (or similar) at the top.  
      – Replace any `/home/jorge/...` with `$PROJECT_ROOT/...` or user‐home expansions (`$HOME/.config/...`).  
   b. Remove all absolute references in docs (e.g. TESTING-GUIDE, README) and replace with `$HOME/project/...` examples or generic placeholders (`~/input-leap`).

3. **Enable “Strict Mode” Everywhere**  
   • Add `set -euo pipefail` at the top of `bin/connect_input_leap.sh` and `bin/install_input_leap.sh`.  
   • Optionally wrap `read` calls with `-r` to prevent backslash escapes.  
   • Run `shellcheck` (or similar) against every script to catch unquoted variables and other common bash pitfalls.

4. **Unify & Document Config-File Layout**  
   a. Decide on a single convention, e.g.:  
      - `$HOME/.config/input-leap/server.conf`  
      - `$HOME/.config/input-leap/network.conf`  
      - `$HOME/.config/input-leap/client.conf`  
   b. Update each script to read/write the appropriate file, in one central `CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.config/input-leap"`.  
   c. Audit all references in the README, comments, and service-unit templates to ensure they match.

5. **Make the Installer Cross-Distro**  
   a. At the top of `install_input_leap.sh` and `setup-ubuntu.sh`, detect the distro:  
      - For Debian/Ubuntu: use `apt install`  
      - For Arch/Manjaro: use `pacman` (and AUR fallback)  
      - Else: fail fast with “unsupported distro” message.  
   b. Factor out package‐installation logic into functions (`install_from_official`, `install_from_aur`, `install_from_apt`).  
   c. Update the README’s “Quick Start” to reflect per-distro commands.

6. **Harden Configuration Sourcing**  
   • Instead of raw `source "$CONFIG"`, parse only approved keys (e.g. `grep '^SERVER=' "$CONFIG"`), or at minimum document in the README that the config file must be trusted.  
   • Validate key formats (e.g. host:port) before using them.

7. **Improve Error Handling & Logging**  
   • After every `sudo` call (copying files, systemctl daemon-reload), check `$?` and bail with a clear error if it failed.  
   • Standardize log locations (e.g. `$HOME/.cache/input-leap/install.log`).  
   • Ensure all long-running commands time out or have retries where appropriate (e.g. network tests, DHCP requests).

8. **Update Documentation & Examples**  
   • Sync the “Project Structure” section in README with the actual `bin/` contents.  
   • Remove absolute-path examples in “Testing Guide” and replace with project-root or placeholder.  
   • Clearly document the new config directory layout, distro-detection behavior, and tools required (e.g. `nc`, `timeout`, `systemctl --user`).

9. **Testing & Continuous Integration**  
   • Write a small “smoke-test” script that runs each major command (`leap network status`, `leap config`, `leap start`, `leap status`, `leap stop`) in a dry-run or VM.  
   • Integrate `shellcheck` into CI to catch regressions.  
   • Optionally add a `--dry-run` flag to `configure_static_ip` and other destructive operations for safe testing.

10. **Roll-out & Versioning**  
    • Tag a “v2.0” once breaking changes (paths, config layout, distro logic) are complete.  
    • In release notes, list all user-facing changes, especially any manual steps for upgrading old configs or services.
